            <strong>Welcome to the Draw Ball Box!</strong> <br />
            This app is designed to create various shapes and forms by
            manipulating balls. You can add, move, and interact with the balls
            to form interesting patterns and designs.
          </p>

          <h3>1. Adding a New Ball:</h3>
          <p>
            Click on the beachball icon to add a new ball to the box. The ball
            will be randomly colored and will appear in the box.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Selecting a Ball:</h3>
          <p>
            Click on the ball to select it. The selected ball will get bright
            red color for the time of selection. To unselect the ball, click on
            it again.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Moving the Ball:</h3>
          <p>
            Once a ball is selected, use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right)
            on the keyboard to move it in the desired direction. The ball will
            avoid collisions with other balls and will bounce away if a
            collision occurs!
          </p>

          <h3>4. Removing a Ball:</h3>
          <p>
            To remove the selected ball, press the
            <strong>Backspace</strong> key on the keyboard.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Moving the Ball with the Mouse:</h3>
          <p>
            Double-click anywhere inside the container to move the selected ball
            to that location. The ball will be placed at the point where you
            clicked.When positions of two balls collide inside the container,
            the affected ball will trigger a shake effect.
          </p>

          <h3>6. Interacting with Balls:</h3>
          <p>
            You can only have one selected ball at a time. Whenever you click on
            a ball, any previously selected balls will be unselected.
          </p>

            This app allows you to create and interact with a variety of shapes
